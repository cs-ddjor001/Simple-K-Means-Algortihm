Include Headers: We include necessary C++ headers such as <iostream>, <vector>, <cstdlib>, and <ctime>.

Point Struct: We define a Point struct to represent a 2-dimensional data point with x and y coordinates.

calculateDistance Function: This function calculates the Euclidean distance between two points using the formula: sqrt((x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2) 

assignPointsToCentroids Function: This function assigns each data point to the nearest centroid based on Euclidean distance.

updateCentroids Function: This function updates the centroids by calculating the mean of all data points assigned to each centroid.

kMeans Function: This is the main K-means clustering function. It initializes centroids randomly, then iteratively assigns points to centroids and updates centroids until convergence or until reaching a maximum number of iterations.

main Function: In the main function, we define some sample data points, specify the number of clusters (k), and the maximum number of iterations. We then call the kMeans function to perform K-means clustering and print the resulting centroids.

Random Initialization: Centroids are initialized randomly using rand() function.

Iteration: The algorithm iterates a fixed number of times (maxIterations). In each iteration, it assigns points to centroids and updates centroids accordingly.

Output: Finally, the centroids calculated by the K-means algorithm are printed to the console.

So, why is this implementation and inneficient?
    - Random Initialization: The centroids are initialized randomly, which means there's no guarantee that they are close to the actual clusters. 
        This can lead to slower convergence and potentially suboptimal clustering.
    - Brute-Force Assignments: The assignPointsToCentroids function iterates through each data point and calculates its distance to each centroid. 
        This brute-force approach results in a time complexity of O(n*k), where n is the number of data points and k is the number of clusters. 
        This can be highly inefficient for large datasets and/or a large number of clusters.
    - Full Data Point Updates: In the updateCentroids function, all data points are considered for each iteration to update the centroids. 
        This approach can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets, as it requires iterating through all data points for each iteration.
    - No Convergence Criteria: The algorithm performs a fixed number of iterations (maxIterations) regardless of whether convergence has been reached. 
        This can lead to unnecessary computations, especially if convergence is achieved before reaching the maximum number of iterations.
    - Lack of Optimization Techniques: This implementation lacks optimization techniques such as using efficient data structures, 
        early stopping criteria, or smart initialization methods (e.g., K-means++). These techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and convergence 
        speed of the algorithm
TLDR: This implementation sacrifices efficiency for simplicity.
